# Recruitment and Selection Process Automation [Concept]

[Concept]

The primary purpose of this service is the automation of the recruitment and selection process for employers and assisting candidates in skills improvement, knowledge acquisition, career development, and finding desired jobs.

The service consists of two parts: a section for candidates and a section for employers.

## Candidates:

- Candidates are required to fill out and update their profiles. The incentive for this would be better access to career development resources and a personalized approach to job selection based on their competencies and aspirations.
- Gamification is an integral part of the personal profile update process.
- Candidates have the option to choose a career(s) they would like to pursue [defined job categories]. After selecting their desired career path, the algorithm, based on the choice and entered competencies and prior work experience, supports the candidate's career path.
- The relationship between career development and the necessary knowledge and skills that a candidate can improve through Career Development. Learning resources would be organized according to knowledge levels. Automation for finding materials from available services [e.g., YouTube, Khan Academy, SkillShare, Alison, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, and others].
- Candidates have the option to take personality, knowledge, and skills tests. Re-testing would be possible after a certain period. Test results may be optionally public.
- Job advertisements are sorted according to user preferences and the existence of candidate competencies required by the job.
- Candidates without the knowledge/skills required by an open position would not have the option to apply for that position.
- Candidates can generate an electronic version of their work biography.
- Candidates have the option to rate working conditions and leave reviews.
- Materials for stress management, work-life balance, expected behavior on the first day at work, optimal behavior during interviews, and more are available to candidates.
- The number of applications is limited within a certain time period.

## Employers:

- The ability to advertise open positions. Salary information is mandatory.
- Employers have access to the candidate's career profile and the results of their tests (candidate contents that have applied for a job at the employer's discretion).
- The interpretation of tests (e.g., personality tests) would be automated based on expert knowledge in the specific psychological instrument field.
- Employers have access to the ATS service [applicant tracking system] for managing candidate selection. In addition to candidates who have applied for the job ad, the employer may include candidates who have previously applied to the employer's ads, provided that this is in line with the active GDPR.
- The rating received by the candidate (anonymously) in the ATS (together with the ratings of other employers) would manage the algorithm for sorting candidates in the ATS ('talent score' and others).
- INTERVIEW: Employers have access to an audio/video interview service with the candidate. Before the interview, there is an option to generate interview questions based on required competencies. Each question would contain expert explanations of good and bad answers. The interviewer is familiar with candidate behavior aspects to pay attention to during the interview.
- Employers/users have the ability to add their questions and rate those offered (adjusting the question generator to the interview style [behavioral, informational, problem-solving, etc.]). Based on the additionally entered questions, the rating of existing questions, user activity information, and the type of job, the algorithm generates a list of interview questions.
- Candidates and interviewers are notified of the start of the interview via notifications.

## Miscellaneous:

- All correspondence between the employer and the candidate works through the notification system.
- Employers have the option to set 'default' selection steps according to their own preferences.
- The application contains a notification system for candidates and employers.
